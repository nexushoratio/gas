# GAS

Essentially, this is a Python implementation of [google/clasp](https://www.github.com/google/clasp).

I am still running Debian Bookworm and I *prefer* to use whatever software came with that distribution.  As a result, many things are outdated, and I refuse to use things like CPAN, PIP, NPM, or `telnet HOST | sh` to install/update software.  (I do hope to upgrade to Trixie, but it has not happened yet).

I am likely to only implement what I want/need.  But once this actually gets going, I would not be against accepting patches.

It will depend on my [nexushoratio/mundane](https://www.github.com/nexushoratio/py-mundane) project.  But, considering my concern for supply chain management attacks, I doubt I will ever push it to PIP.
